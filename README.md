# Welcome to Kitra!

**Kitra** is a game where users can collect treasures in a given latitude and longitude. Every treasure that is collected will have points based on the monetary value. A treasure may have more than one money value, it depends on the userâ€™s luck. Kitra users may get the highest money from the treasure that has been collected.

## Getting started

- Clone the **Kitra** repository in your computer.
- **Install** the dependencies of the project by opening terminal and run command below:

```
npm install
```

- After installing, **run the project**. As for me, I execute the command below.

```
nodemon index.js
```

- I have provided **kitra.postman_collection** so that you may be able to **import** it on your postman for testing the project.
- **Open your postman application** and **import the collection file** which is located on root folder of the repository.
